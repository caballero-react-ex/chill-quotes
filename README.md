## Description 
A ReactJS web straight forward application using the create-react-app. The app consumes data from the [Quote Garden REST API](https://github.com/pprathameshmore/QuoteGarden) and deliver to the user a quote than can be copied to the clipboard or share directly in Twitter. 


## Motivation
This project was created by myself with the intention of getting a better understanding of React. I wanted to create my own small project so I could get my hands dirty and not just follow an online tutorial. 

My goals with this project were: 
1) Learn how to consume an API.
2) Get a better understanding how React Hooks works.
3) Learn about PropTypes.
4) Get comfortable with the ReactJS ecosystem.

After learning how to use axios and the fetch API, I and decided to stick to the fetch API so I could avoid an extra dependency. 

The majority of the react components and logic was written from scratch by myself. I chose not to use existing component libraries because that forces me to get a better understanding of React and I could practice my SCSS styling skills. 

## Tech Used
- React (create-react-app)
- SASS
- Fetch API
- Proptypes
- React-uuid
